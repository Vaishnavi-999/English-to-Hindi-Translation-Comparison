# English-to-Hindi-Translation-Comparison
Two English–Hindi translation projects using the IIT Bombay dataset. The first uses an LSTM encoder–decoder trained from scratch with low accuracy. The second uses fine tuning on a pre trained model, achieving about 95% accuracy. Both are deployed as FastAPI APIs on Hugging Face Spaces.
